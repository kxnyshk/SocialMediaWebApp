# Social Media Web Application
Project done for my university's 7th semester project evaluation.

## About
 - A social media web application, curated for travellers and the travelling community to showcase and post about their various expeditions online among the community.
 - Helps create and foster a nurturing, lovable and safe space for the users online with similar interests and goals towards travelling and exploring the world.
 - Built using React.js, with Node and Express serving the backend and MongoDB as the backend database.

## Run
 - Fetch the [repo](https://github.com/kxnyshk/SocialMediaWebApp/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) as zip.
 - Open separate terminals for both **`client/`** and **`server/`** sub directories
 - Run command **`npm i --legacy-peer-deps`** in both the terminals to install the required repos
 - Run commands **`npm start`** for the client and **`nodemon index.js`** for the server to run the application
 - The application will get successfully started at **`localhost:3000`**, with the server running at **`localhost:5000`** respectively
